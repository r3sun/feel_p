# feel_p
## feel_p gives you a feeling of coding in the terminal without actually thinking about it.

It is just a psudo code generator that prints a line of code for each letter you type in the terminal. The source code it prints from is the source code of `ls.c`, `grep.c`, `ed.c`, and `echo.c` from the V6 UNIX source code from [UNIX Heritage Society](https://www.tuhs.org/).

## How to feel p:

Just download the `feel_p.c` file and compile it with you preffered **C** compiler.

### If you wish:
  You can put it in a directory that is in your **`path`** environment variable so that you can access it from anywhere you want.

## BUGS:
 Haven't found one yet.
 
## Note:
 I haven't tried it on my Linux system yet. So Linux users might get a bug regarding disabling line buffering in the program. However, I will update the program as soon as I try it on my Linux system.
