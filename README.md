# feel_p
## feel_p gives you a feeling of coding in the terminal without actually thinking about it.

It is just a psudo code generator that prints a line of code for each letter you type in the terminal. The source code it prints from is the source code of `ls.c`, `grep.c`, `ed.c`, and `echo.c` from the V6 UNIX source code from [UNIX Heritage Society](https://www.tuhs.org/).
